I did my final project together with a partner in collaboration with Qognify company.
The project written in NodeJS & JS using MongoDB on backend and REACT
on frontend, using async threads, sockets, message queue and more advance
technologies. The server receives metadata from Qognify's video analytic server
(that reqognize objects using NVIDIA DEEPSTREAM and YOLO) through rabbitMQ
message queue, save it on DB, and replys to clients queries on sockets. The client
searching specific man or car (or both) in specific cameras and time range and
display the results.
